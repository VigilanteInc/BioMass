    title =  Gas Compressor: Kethane
    manufacturer = Stodola, LLC.
    description = Kethane gas is immensely dangerous in gas form since it is highly flamable. It's best to compress the stuff and store it as a liquid in one of the high quality tanks produced by the Organization of Kethane Equipment Producers. This has been a paid advertisement from the Organization of Kethane Equipment Producers. OKEP: not a drug cartel.
