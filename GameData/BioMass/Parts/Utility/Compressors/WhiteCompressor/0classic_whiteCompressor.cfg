    manufacturer = Stodola, LLC.
    description = Originally conceived as a medical device to provide oxygen to patients at rates far greater than natural, and thus speed recovery, initial tests did not show positive outcomes for patients. Unwilling to abandon the R&D investment, Stodola, LLC offered it to the KSP, which gladly accepted the technology to convert oxygen to oxidizer and back again.
