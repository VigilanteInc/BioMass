   @description=As a part of the war effort, Stodola LLC attempted to manufacture a series of compressed gas weapons. Once the war ended, the Compressed Comblaminator 9000 was rebranded a CO2 Gas Compressor and offered to the KSP, where it can be used with better intentions, but sometimes the same results.

  @description = Sometimes you just need to stop and smell the flowers. With the Greenhouse module, you don't even need to stop; you can do so while zipping through space! Kamboo, selected for its staggeringly fast growth and absolute requirement for infrared light (IR) for germination, is the ideal plant for closed systems. Once in operation, these modules can filter the air, clean waste water, and provide a relaxing vista for weary Kerbal space travelers. Or you can harvest the biomass and seeds for use in making other useful materials, like snacks and fuel.

  @description = Based on biofuel designs in use at the end of the war, the bioreactor is a space-ready, state-of-the-art hydrothermal liquefaction and catalytic hydrothermal gasification reactor and refinery. A combination of high temperature and pressure, coupled with extremophile microorganisms growing on the specially constructed interior surfaces generate a series of intermediate compounds that even scientists find boring to keep track of. Let's just say that biocake goes in and liquid fuel comes out...along with gasses and sometimes water.

  @description = Regardless of how tidy you are, there's always a little something that you need to store, but you'd rather not. This is doubly true in space when you are dealing with biological waste. Once filled with water, the microbiome provides a suitable environment to cultivate Mystery Goo™, which happily decomposes biowaste, generating hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen, or generates kethane under anaerobic conditions. One can also add water to the device to generate waste water...if you're into that sort of thing.
