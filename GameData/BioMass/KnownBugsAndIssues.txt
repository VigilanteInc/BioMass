Known bugs/issues

*To select "classic" must first click on another difficulty level button, and then click on "classic"
*It would be nice to be able to reload the database without the moduleManager reload window
*Returning to the difficulty menu from any building, the difficulty button is not depressed
*Activating a button on the BioReactor activates the animation, but activating another button on it makes the animation go again. Same for shutting off one, and then shutting off another.
*Thereâ€™s no way to hide the status info of always active modules
