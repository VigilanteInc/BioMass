    description = When Kerbal Geographic Society first approached manufacturers to produce storage containers for use on long kerrestrial voyages, most businesses proposed storing food in cardboard boxes. Only Sklifosovsky Labs managed to produce a storage solution that met the needs of the KGS. Later, when Kerbal Space Command faced similar needs, turning to Sklifosovsky was a natural move, and their latest space-ready food-storage containers are guaranteed to actually store food.
