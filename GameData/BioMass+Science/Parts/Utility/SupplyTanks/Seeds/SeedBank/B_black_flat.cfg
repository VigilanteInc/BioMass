    description = Archaeologists had thought that agriculture was to first critical step toward urbanization. Ruins found underwater, east of the Isthmus of Kamm have forced a re-evaluation of that, indicating that storage of seeds was necessary before agriculture. Sklifosovsky Labs is proud to bring you most advanced way to store seeds in the history of history.
