description = This tank is designed to hold compressed carbon dioxide, the last of the gasses discovered by the famous chemist Kan Thomas van Kerbin. There has been a great deal of speculation as to whether the CO2 is a liquid or a gas while in this tank. Most researchers believe it exists in both forms until you look, at which point something explodes.
