	description = When you are low and food and far from home things can look bleak. To stave off sure depression, DG Aero-Space has designed the BioCaker to supply all your food-on-the-go needs. Various vacuums and pistons combine biocake and seeds into a gastronomic delight DG Aero-Space calls "Koylent," though most just call it "food."
