BioMass Science+... Updated 2014.01.16

Creators:

Science = seanth

Models = Roboto

===========================

IMPORTANT: This mod requires Kethane's MMI_Kethane.dll (http://mirror.nabaal.net/files/kethane/Kethane-0.8.2.zip)

IMPORTANT AS WELL: If you would like to change difficulty levels, you need Module Manager installed (https://github.com/Ialdabaoth/ModuleManager/blob/master/ModuleManager.dll?raw=true)

To do shortlist:
   ---TEST!!!
   ---Work on food production
   ---Finish aquatic greenhouse (difficulties, animations, etc)
   ---Add difficulties to small greenhouses
   ---Add small aquatic greenhouse
   ---Make sure tanks hold reasonable amounts

To do midlist:
   ---Add science experiments to small greenhouses
   ---Add real science results to science parts (this is how plants grow and this is what you need)

To do long-term:
   ---Better generator so things keep producing/consuming when not selected
   ---Maybe even do real plant growth modeling (self promotion: http://www.amjbot.org/content/96/8/1430.short)

Change Log:

(2014-01-31)
   ---Fixed seed production problem (hopefully)

(2014-01-28)
   ---Updated in-line microbiome (only 'Normal' mode)
   ---Fixed small plant greenhouse resizing
   ---Changed "waste" resource density (need to post new TAC-LS setup values)

(2014-01-24)

   ---Fixed tech nodes for greenhouses

(2014-01-23)

   ---Fixed Food and Waste densities and flowMode so they will play nice with TAC Life Support

   ---Added ability to collect science data from the biology study parts
   
   ---Rebalanced BioReactor (only exists as 'Normal' mode)
   
   ---New Greenhouse: Aquatic Greenhouse (model still being worked on)
   
   ---New Greenhouse: small plant greenhouse (only exists as 'Normal' mode)

(2014-01-16)

   ---Difficulty levels worked in for Greenhouse and Compressors. Easy, Normal, Hard. Each difficulty level produces different amounts of O2, total biomass, and grows at different rates.

   ---Fixed attachment of the large science experiment.

(2014-01-16):
   ---Fixed attachment rules for Bio Containment Study part

(2013-12-12):
   ---Chemical reactions scienceified.

   ---Play balancing(i.e. removed some things)

   ---Resource Definitions Updated and standardized...give or take.

   ---Cross-Mod resource support strengthened (TAC Life Support, IonCross)

BioMass Mod for KSP

Modular Greenhouses for cultivating photosynthetic organisms that can be consumed in
a Bio-Mass Reactor to produce standard, yet renewable fuel types!

Created all new parts config files

Removed GLite resource, and changed the way the modules work altogether.

Updated for KSP 0.21, Fixed file structure

Greenhouses:
   Greenhouses start devoid of life. Transfer seeds into the greenhouses and expose the seeds to light. They will germinate into biomass.

   If there is light CO2 and water present, the biomass will grow, producing more biomass and releasing oxygen.

   In the absence of light biomass will consume oxygen and reduce in mass, releasing CO2 and water. It will also produce seeds.

   Using waste water in the greenhouses will increase biomass growth rates and help produce clean water.

   Greenhouses have a harvester mechanism which harvests biomass into biocake, which can the used in either the BioReactor of the Koylent maker.

Koylent maker:
   The koylent maker takes biocake and seeds and turns it into food for your kerbals.

BioReactor:
   The bioreactor is where biocake is fermented and combined with other gasses to produce liquid fuel, and gasses such as CO2, H2 and O2.

Composter:
   The composter allows you to degrade practically anything (even liquid fuel) to either CO2 and H2, or Kethane and O2.

Cryogenic air seperator:
    This handy device will take atmospheric gasses (though a jet-engine air intake) and break it into it's constituant components (O2, CO2, H2, Kethane, Xenon...). These gasses can then be stored for later use

Compressors:
    The H2, O2 and CO2 compressors will allow you you compress gasses to save space or make much needed fuels (O2-->oxidizer, H2-->monopropellant)

Sciencers:
    Use the BioScience parts to add to your science research bounty.
