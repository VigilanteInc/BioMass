BioMass WIP: Updated 2014.09.29

Creators:

Models and most of the code = Roboto
Science and some of the code = seanth



===========================
Major reworking of how BioMass works:

1.) Brand new custom dlls that allow BioMass parts to continue to work even when ship are not selected, and a means of changing difficulty in-game.

2.) New parts, imporved animations, etc.

Lots of play balancing left to do!

Update 0.2.0.0 (2014.09.29):
	-Added version file for Automatic Version Control (AVC) mod integration (suggested by Bit Fiddler)
	-Added file paths to resources for use by Alternate Resource Panel mod.
	-Fixed purple icon in toolbar at Space Center view (bug reported by Bit Fiddler)
    -In-flight button moved
	-Made "Easy" play mode a mass-balanced version of Classic (mass balance bug reported by KBluey). Seanth is punching himself in the head. Note: there are no plans to alter how Classic works.
	-Most "Easy" play mode parts shifted into Utility vs Classic having them in "Science".
	-Some "Easy" play mode parts have slightly different description compared to "Classic" to make it easier to go from Easy to Hard.
    -Misc spelling and other fixes
